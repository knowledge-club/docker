# ps

The `ps` command shows the containers you have.

- By default this command only shows the running containers:
```shell
docker ps
```

- To see all containers that you have you can use the `-a` or `--all` flag:
```shell
docker ps -a
# or
docker ps --all
```

- You can do much more with the `ps` command, but we will see more about it later.
